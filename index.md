## Welcome!

Hey you, I am Yugansh a computer science graduate from IIIT Delhi, India. My fields of interest are Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics. I completed my undergrad from Galgotias University with 8.45 CGPA. I have cleared GATE 2021 with AIR 1649.

I have done multiple machine learning projects as can be seen on my [github profile](https://github.com/yugpsyfer). Apart from machine learning I love coding and making small web-apps.
